## Readme file : what has been done ?

## Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
To speed up the index.html main portofolio page. Different changes have been carried, listed above. The page reaches a mobile PageSpeed of 96 and a desktop PageSpeed of 97.

### Inlining and minifying CSS
Since there are only few CSS commands, they can be inlined to boost performance. It has also been minified http://cssminifier.com

### Asynchronous scripts
According to Google (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/#alternative_async_tracking_snippet), the Analytics script can be loaded asynchronously. 

### print.css command at the end of html
For performance reasons, the print.css file can be linked at the end of the file. But there are some discussions around the Internet if this is HTML5 compliant. See for instance : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21058207/why-does-code-after-html-tag-get-moved-to-before-body-is-there-a-performa. I leaved it here, but it could have been linked before the body closing tag.

### Image compression
Images were compressed to smaller sizes using jpegtran. Command:
 
```
jpegtran -copy none -optimize -progressive pizzeria.jpg > pizzeria_optimized.jpg
```

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
